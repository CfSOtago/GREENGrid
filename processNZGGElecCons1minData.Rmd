# Introduction

Report circulation:

 * Restricted to: [NZ GREEN Grid](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/research/energy/otago050285.html) project partners and contractors.

## Purpose

This report is intended to: 

 * load and clean the project electricity power data (Grid Spy)
 * save the cleaned data out as a single file per household
 * produce summary data quality statistics

The resulting cleaned data has _no_ identifying information such as names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers and is therefore safe to share across all partners.

The data contains a unique household id which can be used to link it to the NZ GREEN Grid time use diaries and dwelling/appliance surveys. With some additional non-disclosure checks it should also be safe to archive all of these linkable datasets for re-use via the UK [reshare](http://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/) service.

## Requirements:

 * grid spy 1 minute data downloads

# Obtain listing of files

In this section we generate a listing of all 1 minute data files that we have received. If we are running over the complete dataset then we will be using data from:

 * /hum-csafe/Research Projects/GREEN Grid/_RAW DATA/GridSpyData/
 
In this run we are using data from:

 * `r fpath`

If these do not match then this may be a test run.

```{r getCompleteFileList}

print(paste0("Looking for 1 minute data using pattern = ", pattern1Min, " in ", fpath, " - could take a while..."))
system.time(fListCompleteDT <- data.table::as.data.table(list.files(path = fpath, pattern = pattern1Min, # use the default pattern to filter e.g. 1m from 30s files
                                            recursive = TRUE)))

nFiles <- nrow(fListCompleteDT)
print(paste0("Found ", tidyNum(nFiles), " files"))
```

```{r processCompleteFileList}

  stop(paste0("No matching data files found, please check your path (", fpath, ") or your search pattern (", pattern1Min, ")"))
} else {

  fListCompleteDT <- fListCompleteDT[, fullPath := paste0(fpath, hhID,"/",fileName)]
  loopCount <- 1
  # now loop over the files and collect metadata
  for(f in fListCompleteDT[,fullPath]){
    rf <- path.expand(f) # just in case of ~ etc
    fsize <- file.size(rf)
    fmtime <- lubridate::ymd_hms(file.mtime(rf), tz = "Pacific/Auckland") # requires lubridate

    fListCompleteDT <- fListCompleteDT[fullPath == f, fMTime := fmtime]
    fListCompleteDT <- fListCompleteDT[fullPath == f, fMDate := as.Date(fmtime)]

    if(fsize > dataThreshold){
      if(fullFb){print(paste0("fSize (", fsize, ") > threshold (", dataThreshold, ") -> loading ", f))}
      row1DT <- fread(f, nrows = 1)

      fListCompleteDT <- fListCompleteDT[fullPath == f, dateColName := "unknown - can't tell"]
      if(nrow(dplyr::select(row1DT, dplyr::contains("NZ"))) > 0){ # requires dplyr
        setnames(row1DT, 'date NZ', "dateTime_char")
        row1DT <- row1DT[, dateColName := "date NZ"]
        fListCompleteDT <- fListCompleteDT[fullPath == f, dateColName := "date NZ"]
      } 
      if(nrow(dplyr::select(row1DT, dplyr::contains("UTC"))) > 0){ # requires dplyr

      if(fullFb){print(paste0("Checking date formats in ", f))}

      if(fullFb){print(paste0("Done ", f))}
    }
    loopCount <- loopCount + 1
  }

  # any date formats are still ambiguous need a deeper inspection using the full file - could be slow
  fAmbig <- fListCompleteDT[dateFormat == "ambiguous", fullPath]
  
  for(fa in fAmbig){
    if(baTest | fullFb){print(paste0("Checking ambiguous date formats in ", fa))}
    ambDT <- fread(fa)
    if(nrow(dplyr::select(ambDT, dplyr::contains("NZ"))) > 0){ # requires dplyr
      setnames(ambDT, 'date NZ', "dateTime_char")
    } 
    if(nrow(dplyr::select(ambDT, dplyr::contains("UTC"))) > 0){ # requires dplyr
      setnames(ambDT, 'date UTC', "dateTime_char")
    }
    ambDT <- ambDT[, c("date_char", "time_char") := data.table::tstrsplit(dateTime_char, " ")]
    ambDT <- gs_checkDates(ambDT)
    # set what we now know (or guess!)
    fListCompleteDT <- fListCompleteDT[fullPath == fa, dateFormat := ambDT[1,dateFormat]]
  }
      
  ofile <- paste0(outPath, fListInterim)
  print(paste0("Saving 1 minute data files interim metadata to ", ofile))
  write.csv(fListCompleteDT, ofile)
  print("Done")
}

print(paste0("Overall we have ", nrow(fListCompleteDT), " files from ", uniqueN(fListCompleteDT$hhID), " households."))

# for use below
nFiles <- nrow(fListCompleteDT)
nFilesNotLoaded <- nrow(fListCompleteDT[dateColName %like% "unknown"])
```

Overall we have `r tidyNum(nFiles)` files from `r tidyNum(uniqueN(fListCompleteDT$hhID))` households. Of the `r tidyNum(nFiles)`,  `r tidyNum(nFilesNotLoaded)` (`r round(100*(nFilesNotLoaded/nFiles),2)`%) were _not_ loaded/checked as their file sizes indicated that they contained no data.

We now need to check how many of the loaded files have an ambiguous or default date - these could introduce errors.

```{r initialDateFormatTable}

# short cut if file list already saved ----
#ifile <- paste0(outPath, fListInterim)
#print(paste0("Loading 1 minute data files interim metadata to ", ifile))
#fListCompleteDT <- fread(ifile)
  
  
t <- fListCompleteDT[, .(nFiles = .N), keyby = .(dateColName, dateFormat)]

knitr::kable(caption = "Number of files with given date column names by inferred date format", t)
```

Results to note:

 * There are `r nrow(fListCompleteDT[dateFormat == "ambiguous"])` ambiguous files
 * The non-loaded files only have 2 distinct file sizes, confirming that they are unlikely to contain useful data. 
 
We now inspect the ambiguous and (some of) the default files.

To help with data cleaning the following table lists files that are ambiguous.

```{r listAmbigFiles}
# list ambigious files
aList <- fListCompleteDT[dateFormat == "ambiguous", .(file = V1, dateColName, dateExample, dateFormat)]

knitr::kable(caption = "Files with ambigious date formats", aList)

```

Looking at the file names we will assume they are dmy.

```{r setAmbiguous}
fListCompleteDT <- fListCompleteDT[dateFormat == "ambiguous", dateFormat := "dmy - inferred"]
```


The following table lists 'date NZ' files which are set by default only - do they look OK to assume dateFormat?

```{r listDefaultDateFilesNZT}
# list default files
aList <- fListCompleteDT[dateColName == "date NZ" & dateFormat %like% "default", .(file = V1, fSize, dateColName, dateExample, dateFormat)]

knitr::kable(caption = "Files with inferred default date formats", head(aList))

```

These look OK if we compare the file names with the dateExample.

The following table lists 'date NZ' files which are set by default only - do they look OK to assume dateFormat?

```{r listDefaultDateFilesUTC}
# list default files
aList <- fListCompleteDT[dateColName == "date UTC" & dateFormat %like% "default", .(file = V1, fSize, dateColName, dateExample, dateFormat)]

knitr::kable(caption = "Files with inferred default date formats", head(aList))


```

These also look OK so we will stick with the following derived date formats:

```{r finalDateFormatTable}
t <- fListCompleteDT[, .(nFiles = .N), keyby = .(dateColName, dateFormat)]

knitr::kable(caption = "Number of files with given date column names by final imputed date format", t)
```

## Data file quality checks

The following chart shows the distribution of these files over time using their sizes. Note that white indicates the presence of small files which may not contain observations.

```{r allFileSizesPlot}
myCaption <- paste0("Data source: ", fpath,
                    "\nUsing data received up to ", Sys.Date())

plotDT <- fListCompleteDT[, .(nFiles = .N,
                              meanfSize = mean(fSize)), 
                          keyby = .(hhID, date = as.Date(fMDate))]

ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes( x = date, y = hhID, fill = log(meanfSize))) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "black") + 
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y %b", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5)) + 
  labs(title = "Mean file size of all grid spy data files received per day",
       caption = paste0(myCaption, 
                        "\nLog file size used as some files are full year data")
    
  )
ggplot2::ggsave(paste0(outPath, "gridSpyAllFileListSizeTilePlot.png"))
```


The following chart shows the same chart but only for files which we think contain data.

```{r loadedFileSizesPlot}
myCaption <- paste0("Data source: ", fpath,
                    "\nUsing data received up to ", Sys.Date())

plotDT <- fListCompleteDT[!is.na(dateFormat), .(nFiles = .N,
                              meanfSize = mean(fSize)), 
                          keyby = .(hhID, date = as.Date(fMDate))]

ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes( x = date, y = hhID, fill = log(meanfSize))) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "black") + 
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y %b", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5)) + 
  labs(title = "Mean file size of loaded grid spy data files received per day",
       caption = paste0(myCaption, 
                        "\nLog file size used as some files are full year data",
                        "\nFiles loaded if fsize > ", dataThreshold, " bytes")
    
  )
ggplot2::ggsave(paste0(outPath, "gridSpyLoadedFileListSizeTilePlot.png"))
```

# Load data files

In this section we load the data files that have a file size > `r dataThreshold` bytes. Things to note:

 * We assume that any files smaller than this value have no observations. This is based on:
     * Manual inspection of several small files
     * The identical (small) file sizes involved
     * _But_ we should probably test the first few lines to double check...
 * We have to deal with quite a lot of duplication some of which has caused the different date formats. See our [repo issues list](https://git.soton.ac.uk/ba1e12/nzGREENGrid/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all).
 
The following table shows the number of files per household that we willl load.

```{r filesToLoadTable}
filesToLoadDT <- fListCompleteDT[!is.na(dateFormat)]

t <- filesToLoadDT[, .(nFiles = .N,
                       meanSize = mean(fSize),
                       minFileDate = min(fMDate),
                       maxFileDate = max(fMDate)), keyby = .(hhID)]

knitr::kable(caption = "Summary of household files to load", t)
```

# Data quality analysis

Now produce some data quality plots & tables.

The following table shows the number of data files with different circuit labels by household. In theory there should only be one unique list per household and it should be present in every data file. If this is not the case then this implies that:

 * some of the circuit labels for these households may have been changed during the data collection process;
 * some of the circuit labels may have character conversion errors which have changed the labels during the data collection process;
 * at least one file from one household has been saved to a folder containing data from a different household (unfortunately the raw data files do _not_ contain household IDs in the data or the file names which would enable checking/preventative filtering). This will be visible in the table if two households appear to share _exactly_ the same list of circuit labels.

Some or all of these may be true at any given time!

If this table flags a lot of errors then some re-naming of the circuit labels (column names) may be necessary.

```{r circuitLabelCheck}
t <- fListCompleteDT[!is.na(circuitLabels), .(nFiles = .N,
                                              minObsDate = min(obsStartDate), # helps locate issues in data
                                              maxObsDate = max(obsEndDate),
                                              minFileDate = min(fMDate), # helps locate issues in files
                                              maxFileDate = max(fMDate),
                                              nObs = tidyNum(sum(nObs))),
                     keyby = .(circuitLabels,hhID)] # ignore NA - it is files not loaded due to size thresholds

knitr::kable(caption = "Circuit labels list by household", t)
```


The following plots show the number of observations per day per household. In theory we should not see:

 * dates before 2014 or in to the future. These may indicate:
    * date conversion errors;
 * more than 1440 observations per day. These may indicate:
    * duplicate time stamps - i.e. they have the same time stamps but different power (W) values or different circuit labels;
    * observations from files that are in the 'wrong' rf_XX folder and so are included in the 'wrong' household as 'duplicate' time stamps.

If present both of the latter may have been implied by the table above and would have evaded the de-duplication filter which simply checks each complete row against all others within it's consolidated household dataset (a _within household absolute duplicate_ check).

```{r loadedFilesObsPlots}
# short cut if already generated
# hhStatDT <- as.data.table(read_csv(ofile)) # parses dates

# tile plot ----
ggplot2::ggplot(hhStatDT, aes( x = date, y = hhID, fill = nObs)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "red", high = "green") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y %b", date_breaks = "6 months") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5)) + 
  labs(title = "N observations per household per day for all loaded grid spy data",
       caption = paste0(myCaption,
                        "\nOnly files of size > ", dataThreshold, " bytes loaded")
       
  )
ggplot2::ggsave(paste0(outPath, "gridSpyLoadedFileNobsTilePlot.png"))

# point plot ----
ggplot2::ggplot(hhStatDT, aes( x = date, y = nObs, colour = hhID)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y %b", date_breaks = "6 months") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5)) + 
  labs(title = "N observations per household per day for all loaded grid spy data",
       caption = paste0(myCaption,
                        "\nOnly files of size > ", dataThreshold, " bytes loaded")
       
  )
ggplot2::ggsave(paste0(outPath, "gridSpyLoadedFileNobsPointPlot.png"))
```

The following table shows the min/max observations per day and min/max dates for each household. As above, we should not see:

 * dates before 2014 or in to the future (indicates date conversion errors)
 * more than 1440 observations per day (indicates potentially duplicate observations)
 * non-integer counts of circuits as it suggests some column errors
 
 We should also not see NA in any row (indicates date conversion errors). 
 
 If we do see any of these then we still have data cleaning work to do!

```{r summaryTable}
# Stats table (so we can pick out the dateTime errors)
t <- hhStatDT[, .(minObs = min(nObs),
             maxObs = max(nObs), # should not be more than 1440, if so suggests duplicates
             meanNDataColumns =mean(nDataColumns), #i.e. n circuits
             minDate = min(date),
             maxDate = max(date)),
         keyby = .(hhID)]

knitr::kable(caption = "Summary observation stats by hhID", t)
```


Finally we show the total number of households which we think are still sending data.

```{r liveDataHouseholds}
plotDT <- hhStatDT[, .(nHH = uniqueN(hhID)), keyby = .(date)]

# point plot ----
ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes( x = date, y = nHH)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y %b", date_breaks = "6 months") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5)) + 
  labs(title = "N live households per day for all loaded grid spy data",
       caption = paste0(myCaption,
                        "\nOnly files of size > ", dataThreshold, " bytes loaded")
       
  )
ggplot2::ggsave(paste0(outPath, "gridSpyLiveHouseholdsToDate.png"))

```
