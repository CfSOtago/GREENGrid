# Load and check data

## Load data

In this section we load and describe the pre-processed safe data from `r dFile`. First we load the data.

```{r load and fix ftf data, echo=TRUE}
ftfSafeDT <- data.table::as.data.table(readr::read_csv(dFile))

# create rTime
ftfSafeDT <- ftfSafeDT[, rTime := hms::as.hms(rDateTime)]

```

That loaded `r tidyNum(nrow(ftfSafeDT))` observations.

Next we check for NA in dates and other key variables.

```{r check ftf data, echo = TRUE}
t <- ftfSafeDT[is.na(rDate), .(nObs = .N,
                           meanPackVolts = mean(`Pack volts`)), 
           keyby = .(`Date (GPS)`, `Time (GPS)`)]

kableExtra::kable(caption = "Number of obs and mean pack volts where date cannot be set by original GPS Date and Time", t) %>% kable_styling()

t <- ftfSafeDT[is.na(rTime), .(nObs = .N,
                           meanPackVolts = mean(`Pack volts`)), 
           keyby = .(`Date (GPS)`, `Time (GPS)`)]

kableExtra::kable(caption = "Number of obs and mean pack volts where time cannot be set by original GPS Date and Time", t) %>% kable_styling()

```

We remove these NAs from the data 

> _XX (should we - what does GPS NA mean? no signal?) XX _

```{r removeNA}
# remove NA dates
before <- nrow(ftfSafeDT)
ftfSafeDT <- ftfSafeDT[!is.na(rDate)]
after <- nrow(ftfSafeDT)

pcGPSNA <- round((before - after)/before*100, 2)
```

Doing so removed `r before - after` (`r pcGPSNA` %) observations.

## Check variables of interest for this analysis

Check charger related variables. These are:

 * `Pack amps`
 * `Pack volts`

> DM: "To determine charger power the variables 'Pack volts' and 'Pack amps' give you everything you need (with some extra code to separate out regen, and it is also useful to do some deltas of voltage and SoC over time to deal with noise in the current sensors)."

Multiplying these two will give power in W. Figures \@ref(fig:checkAmps) to \@ref(fig:checkPower) examine the distribution of amps, volts and the derived W.

```{r setCaptions}
# for plots
figCaption <- paste0("FlipTheFleet 'Black Box' test data for ", uniqueN(ftfSafeDT$evID), " vehicles over " ,
                     uniqueN(ftfSafeDT$rDate), " days from ",
                     min(ftfSafeDT$rDate, na.rm = TRUE), " to ", max(ftfSafeDT$rDate, na.rm = TRUE))
```

> Does negative Amps (Figure \@ref(fig:checkAmps)) indicate power flow out or in to the batteries? Presumably in. And we need to filter our regeneration. 

Histogram for -ve and +ve amps.

```{r checkAmps2, fig.cap="Distribution of Pack amp readings by car"}
ftfSafeDT <- ftfSafeDT[, ampFlag := ifelse(`Pack amps` > 0, "Positive amps", "Negative amps")]

t <- ftfSafeDT[, .(nObs = .N), keyby = .(ampFlag, evID)]

kableExtra::kable(t, caption = "Amps check") %>% 
  kable_styling()

ggplot(ftfSafeDT, aes(x = `Pack amps`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  facet_grid(evID ~ ampFlag, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(caption = figCaption)
```

Next we check volts. Again we seperate -ve and +ve values. In this case it appears that we should probably filter out:

 * -ve volts
 * volts > 1000

```{r checkVolts, fig.cap="Distribution of charger volt readings"}
ftfSafeDT <- ftfSafeDT[, voltFlag := ifelse(`Pack volts` > 0, "Positive volts", "Negative volts")]

t <- ftfSafeDT[, .(nObs = .N), keyby = .(voltFlag, evID)]

kableExtra::kable(t, caption = "Volts check") %>% 
  kable_styling()

ggplot(ftfSafeDT, aes(x = `Pack volts`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  facet_grid(evID ~ voltFlag, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(caption = figCaption)
```

Finally (\@ref(fig:checkPower)) we check the derived power values using the following filters:

 * +ve volts only
 * volts < 1000
 
```{r checkPower, fig.cap="Distribution of derived power demand using these filters"}

ftfSafeDT <- ftfSafeDT[`Pack volts` > 0 & `Pack volts` < 1000, powerW := `Pack volts` * `Pack amps`]

ftfSafeDT <- ftfSafeDT[, powerFlag := ifelse(powerW > 0, "Positive power", "Negative power")]

t <- ftfSafeDT[, .(nObs = .N,
                   meanPowerW = round(mean(powerW), 2),
                   minPowerW = min(powerW),
                   maxPowerW = max(powerW)), keyby = .(evID,powerFlag)]

kableExtra::kable(t, caption = "Power check") %>% 
  kable_styling()

ggplot(ftfSafeDT, aes(x = powerW/1000)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  facet_grid(evID ~ powerFlag, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(x = "kW", caption = figCaption)
```

Clearly we need to do some outlier analysis and possibly some data cleaning. We also need to seperate regeneration properly. 

# Analysis: Number of observations over time

Just a simple trend line for each vehicle... Note that the `Reg No` has been replaced with a unique hash ID.

```{r carTrends}
plotDT <- ftfSafeDT[, .(obs = .N), keyby = .(evID, rDate)]

ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes(x = rDate, y = obs, colour = evID)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom") +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Number of observations per day",
       caption = figCaption)
```

# Analysis: Charging over time

We assume that -ve amps (and so -ve power) is current flowing in. For now, we ignore the difference between charging from grid and from regenerative braking.

```{r powerTable}
dt <- ftfSafeDT[, .(meankW = mean(powerW/1000),
                sdkW = sd(powerW/1000),
                mediankW = median(powerW/1000)), keyby = .(evID, ampFlag)]

kableExtra::kable(dt, caption = "Summary of derived power per car") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

Visualise as a simple trend line for -ve power only.

```{r powerTrends}
plotDT <- ftfSafeDT[powerW < 0, .(meankW = mean(powerW)/1000), keyby = .(evID, rDate)]

ggplot2::ggplot(plotDT, aes(x = rDate, y = meankW, colour = evID)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom") +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Mean power (kW) per day",
       caption = paste0(figCaption, "-ve power only"))
```

# Analysis: Timing of charging

As before, we assume -ve `powerW` is a good indicator of charging. 

Figure \@ref(fig:plotChargingTime) shows mean kW (-ve power only) by time of day over the entire test datset of `r uniqueN(ftfSafeDT$rDate)` days from `r min(ftfSafeDT$rDate, na.rm = TRUE)` to `r max(ftfSafeDT$rDate, na.rm = TRUE)`.

```{r plotChargingTime, fig.cap="Inferred charging times and power draw (all data)"}
plotDT <- ftfSafeDT[powerW < 0, .(meanPowerW = mean(powerW)), keyby = .(rTime, rDow,derivedLocation, evID)]

myPlot <- ggplot(plotDT, aes(x = rTime, y = meanPowerW/1000, colour = evID)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rDow ~  derivedLocation) +
  labs(x='Time of Day', y = "Mean kW", caption = figCaption) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") #  legend
  
  myPlot
  
  # myPlot + scale_x_time(breaks = c(hms::as.hms("00:00:00"), hms::as.hms("03:00:00"), hms::as.hms("06:00:00"),
  #                         hms::as.hms("09:00:00"), hms::as.hms("12:00:00"), hms::as.hms("15:00:00"), 
  #                         hms::as.hms("18:00:00"), hms::as.hms("21:00:00"), hms::as.hms("24:00:00")))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:plotChargingTime) seems to show that the very high Amp values occured on one Sunday and we also appear to see some night charging 'not at home' which may indicate our location inference is imperfect. Figure \@ref(fig:plotChargingTimeClean) re-draws this plot excluding the potential Amp errors and taking the mean for weekends and weekdays for clarity.

```{r plotChargingTimeClean, fig.cap="Inferred charging times and power draw (outliers and exactly zero values excluded)", fig.height=6}
ftfSafeDT <- ftfSafeDT[, rWday := "Mon-Fri"]
ftfSafeDT <- ftfSafeDT[rDow == "Sun", rWday := "Sun"]
ftfSafeDT <- ftfSafeDT[rDow == "Sat", rWday := "Sat"]

plotDT <- ftfSafeDT[, .(meanPowerkW = mean(powerW)/1000), keyby = .(rTime, rWday, ampOutlier,derivedLocation, evID)]
  
myPlot <- ggplot(plotDT[ampOutlier == "OK Amp data"], aes(x = rTime, y = meanPowerkW, colour = evID)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(evID + rWday ~ derivedLocation) +
  labs(x='Time of Day', y = "Mean kW", caption = figCaption) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") #  legend
  
myPlot + scale_x_time(breaks = c(hms::as.hms("00:00:00"), hms::as.hms("06:00:00"),
                        hms::as.hms("12:00:00"), hms::as.hms("18:00:00"), hms::as.hms("24:00:00")))
```

We can see that one of the cars appears to be on an overnight charging timer at home although we do still see charging scattered through the rest of the day. 

So where is the non-home charging happening? We need a way to infer other locations without being disclosive.

# Conclusions

Questions to be asked

 * Data:
    + Do the Amp & Volt distributions look right?
    + Cause of Amp outliers?
    + Date/Time NA (`r pcGPSNA` % of observations) are due to a lack of GPS date/time (and lat/long). Does this mean that there is no date/time in the data when GPS has no signal? Our tests suggest that other data (e.g. power etc) is logged even though there is no date/time. Do we need another source of date/time? Could we infer time from seconds since powered on (assumes GPS OK at start-up?)?
 * Research:
    + Do all FlipTheFleet EV owners charge like this?
    + Where are the EVs being charged when not at home and how can we tell?
    + Does it vary by car/tariff/commute pattern/main use?
    + What other patterns exist and how much within-vehicle and between-vehicle variation is there?
