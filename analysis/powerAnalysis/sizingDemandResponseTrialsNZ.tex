\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In our experiennce of designing and running empirical studies, whether
experimental or naturalistic, there is ongoing confusion over the
meaning and role of two key statistical terms:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  statistical power
\item
  statistical significance
\end{itemize}

We have found this to be the case both in academic research where the
objective is to establish `the most likely explanation' under academic
conventions and in applied research where the objective is to `make a
robust decision' based on the balance of evidence and probability.

In this brief paper we respond to these confusions using a worked
example: the design of a hypothetical household electricity demand
response trial in New Zealand which seeks to shift the use of Heat Pumps
out of the evening winter peak demand period. We use this example to
explain and demonstrate the role of statistical signficance in testing
for differences and of both statistical signficance and statistical
power in sample design and decision making.

\section{Error, power, significance and decision
making}\label{error-power-significance-and-decision-making}

Two types of error are of concern in both purely academic research where
the efficacy of an intervention is to be tested and also in applied
research where a decision may then be taken based on the results:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type I: a false positive - an effect is inferred when in fact there is
  none. From a commercial or policy perspective this could lead to the
  implementation of a costly intervention which would be unlikely to
  have the effect expected;
\item
  Type II: a false negative - an effect is not inferred when in fact
  there is one. From a commercial or policy perspective this could lead
  to inaction when an intervention would have been likely to have the
  effect expected.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Type I error}: The significance level (p value) of the statistical
test to be used to test the efficacy of an intervention represents the
extent to which the observed data matches the null model to be tested
(Wasserstein and Lazar 2016). In most trials the null model will be a
measure of `no difference' between control and intervenion groups. By
convention, the p value \emph{threshold} for rejecting the null model
(the risk of a Type I error) is generally set to 0.05 (5\%) although
this choice is entirely subjective. In commercial or policy terms an
action taken on a larger p value (e.g.~setting the p value threshold to
10\%) would increase the risk of making a Type I error and thus
implementing a potentially costly intervention that is unlikely to have
the effect desired. However, as we discuss in more detail below, this is
not necessarily \emph{bad practice} as it may reflect the potential
magnitude of an effect, the decision-maker's tolerance of Type I error
risk and the urgency of action.

\emph{Type II error}: Statistical power is normally set to 0.8 (80\%) by
convention and represents the pre-study risk of making a Type II error
(Greenland et al. 2016). From a commercial or policy perspective
reducing power (e.g.~to 0.7 or 70\%) will therefore increase the risk of
taking no action when in fact the intervention would probably have had
the effect desired. Statistical power calculations enable the
investigator to estimate the sample size that would be needed to
robustly detect an experimental effect with a given risk of a false
positive (Type I error) or false negative (Type II error) result. This
prevents a study from recruiting too few participants to be able to
robustly detect the hypothesised intervention effect (Delmas, Fischlein,
and Asensio 2013) or wasting resources by recruiting a larger sample
than needed.

Previous work has suggested that sample sizes in most energy efficiency
studies may be too low to provide adequate power and so statistically
robust conclusions cannot be drawn at conventional thresholds (Frederiks
et al. 2016) while a more recent review focusing on demand response
studies reached a similar conclusion (Srivastava, Van Passel, and Laes
2018). It is therefore hardly surprising that a number of studies report
effect sizes which are not statistically significant at conventional
thresholds (Srivastava, Van Passel, and Laes 2018), choose to use lower
statistical significance thresholds (Rocky Mountain Institute 2006,
AECOM (2011), CER (2012), Schofield et al. (2015)) or both lower
statistical power values \emph{and} lower statistical significance
thresholds (UKPN 2017,UKPN (2018)).

However it would be wrong to conclude that this is \emph{necessarily}
bad practice. Recent discussions of the role of p values in inference
(Greenland et al. 2016, Wasserstein and Lazar (2016)) should remind us
that decisions should never be based only on statistical significance
thresholds set purely by convention. Rather, inference and thus decision
making should be based on:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  statistic effect size - is it 2\% or 22\% (i.e.~is the result
  \emph{important} or \emph{useful}, ``What is the estimated \emph{bang
  for buck}?'');
\item
  statistic confidence intervals - (i.e.~is there \emph{uncertainty} or
  \emph{variation} in response, ``How uncertain is the estimated
  bang?'');
\item
  statistic p values - (i.e.~what is the risk of a Type I error /
  \emph{false positive}, ``What is the risk the bang observed isn't
  real?'');
\end{itemize}

Only then can a contextually appropriate decision be taken as to whether
the effect is large enough, certain enough and has a low enough risk of
being a false positive result to warrant action.

In the following sections we apply these principles to the design and
analysis of a hypothetical New Zealand household electricity demand
response trial and to the use of a simple statistical test of difference
between trial groups to demonstrate and clarify these points.

\section{Sample design: statistical
power}\label{sample-design-statistical-power}

To return to the discussion of statistical power, we need to establish
the probably size of the control and intervention groups we will
require. This is an aid to resource budgeting (\emph{``How many
households and thus \texttt{\$} do I need?''}) and to ensure good study
design practice (``\emph{Will I be able to answer my research
question?}'') (Frederiks et al. 2016).

Calculation of the required sample size for a control and intervention
group requires the estimation of the probable intervention effect size,
agreement on the significance level (p value threshold or Type I error
risk) of the statistical test to be used and agreement on the level of
statistical power (Type II error risk). Given any three of these values
the fourth can be calculated if an estimate of the mean and standard
deviation of the outcome to be measured is known. In the case of DSR
interventions the effect size comprises a given \% reduction in energy
demand or consumption in a given time period and estimates of the likely
reduction can be derived from previous studies or data.

As we have noted the choice of significance level (p value threshold)
and statistical power are subjective and normative. Most academic
researchers will struggle to justify relaxing from the conventional p =
0.05 and power = 0.8. However as we have discussed there may be good
reason in applied research to take action on results of studies that use
less conservative thresholds. Nevertheless there is a strong argument
for designing such studies using the more conservative conventional
levels but acknowledging that making inferences from the results may
require a more relaxed approach to Type I or Type II error risks than is
considered `normal' in academic research.

As an illustration, \ref(fig:ggHPSampleSizeFig80) shows sample size
calculations for power = 0.8 (80\%) using `Heat Pump' electricity demand
extracted from the publicly available New Zealand Green Grid household
electricity demand data (Anderson et al. 2018) for winter 2015 for the
peak demand period (16:00 - 20:00) on weekdays.

These results show that a trial comprising a control and intervention
sample of 1000 households (each) would be able to detect an effect size
of 14.18\% with p = 0.01 and power = 0.8. Were a study to be less risk
averse in it's decision making then p = 0.1 may be acceptable in which
case only \textasciitilde{} 450 households would be needed in each group
(see \ref(fig:ggHPSampleSizeFig80)) but the risk of a Type I error would
increase.

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Were we to reduce the statistical power to 0.7 then we would obtain the
results shown in \ref(fig:ggHPSampleSizeFig70). In this case a trial
comprising a control and intervention sample of 1000 households (each)
would be able to detect an effect size of 12.76\% with p = 0.01 and
power = 0.7. Were a study to be less risk averse in it's decision making
then p = 0.1 may be acceptable in which case only \textasciitilde{} 425
households would be needed in each group (see
\ref(fig:ggHPSampleSizeFig70)) but as before the risk of a Type I error
would increase. Similarly, reducing the statistical power used would
also reduce the sample required for a given effect size tested at a
given p value. However, as before the risk of a Type II error would
increase.

\section{Testing for differences: effect sizes, confidence intervals and
p
values}\label{testing-for-differences-effect-sizes-confidence-intervals-and-p-values}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Getting it
`wrong'}{Getting it wrong}}\label{getting-it-wrong}

Let us imagine that we have not designed and implemented our sample
recruitment according to \ref(fig:ggHPSampleSizeFig80) and instead
decided, perhaps for cost reasons to recruit \textasciitilde{} 30
households per group. Now we wish to test for differences between the
control and intervention groups.

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{\label{tab:smallNTable}Number of households and summary statistics per group}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r}
\hline
group & mean W & sd W & n households\\
\hline
Control & 162.66915 & 325.51171 & 28\\
\hline
Intervention 1 & 35.13947 & 83.90258 & 22\\
\hline
Intervention 2 & 58.80597 & 113.53102 & 26\\
\hline
Intervention 3 & 68.37439 & 147.37279 & 29\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\includegraphics{sizingDemandResponseTrialsNZ_files/figure-latex/ggMeanDiffs-1.pdf}

As a first step we plot the differences using the mean and 95\%
confidence intervals as shown in \ref(fig:ggMeanDiffs). As we can see
the interventions appear to have reduced demand quite substantially and
the error bars indicate the uncertainty (variation) around the mean
within each group. Based on this, we suspect that we are unlikely to see
low p values when we use statistical tests of the differences as the
error bars overlap substantially.

Suppose a t-test of the difference between the Control and Intervention
1 group produces the result shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  testDT[group == "Intervention 1"]$meanW and testDT[group == "Control"]$meanW
## t = -1.9907, df = 31.47, p-value = 0.05526
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -258.110005    3.050644
## sample estimates:
## mean of x mean of y 
##  35.13947 162.66915
\end{verbatim}

The data shows that the mean power demand for the control group was
162.67W and for Intervention 1 was 35.14W. This is a (very) large
difference in the mean of 127.53. The results of the t test are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  effect size = 128W or 78\% representing a \emph{substantial bang for
  buck} for whatever caused the difference;
\item
  95\% confidence interval for the test = -258.11 to 3.05 representing
  \emph{considerable} uncertainty/variation;
\item
  p value of 0.055 representing a \emph{relatively low} risk of a false
  positive result but which (just) fails the conventional p \textless{}
  0.05 threshold.
\end{itemize}

What would we have concluded? We have a large effect size, substantial
uncertainty and a slightly raised risk of a false positive or Type I
error when compared to conventional p value levels. From a narrow and
conventional `p value testing' perspective we would have concluded that
there was no statistically signficant difference between the groups.
However this misses the crucial point that an organisation with a higher
risk tolerance might conclude that the large effect size justifies
implementing the intervention even though the risk of a false positive
is slightly higher. If the p value had been 0.25 then this would have
still been the case but would have warranted even further caution.

But what about Intervention Group 2? In this case the t.test results are
slightly different:

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  testDT[group == "Intervention 2"]$meanW and testDT[group == "Control"]$meanW
## t = -1.5876, df = 33.909, p-value = 0.1217
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -236.82848   29.10212
## sample estimates:
## mean of x mean of y 
##  58.80597 162.66915
\end{verbatim}

Now:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  effect size = 104W or 63.85\% representing a still \emph{reasonable
  bang for buck} for whatever caused the difference;
\item
  95\% confidence interval for the test = -236.83 to 29.1 representing
  \emph{even greater} uncertainty/variation;
\item
  p value of 0.122 representing a \emph{higher} risk of a false positive
  result which fails the conventional p \textless{} 0.05 threshold and
  also the less conservative p \textless{} 0.1.
\end{itemize}

As before, the subsequent action we take depends on our tolerance of
Type I (falso positive) risk. We still have a reasonably large effect
size but we are less certain about it and we have a higher risk of it
not being real. What do you think we should do?

In both cases our decision-making is rather hampered by the small sample
size even though we have extremely large effect sizes. As we can see
from \ref(fig:ggHPSampleSizeFig80), to detect Intervention Group 2's
effect size of 63.85\% would have required control and trial group sizes
of 47 respectively.

However, as the recent discussions of the role of the p value in
decision making have made clear (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016) statistical
analysis needs to report all of the result elements to enable
contextually appropriate and defensible evidence-based decisions to be
taken. Simply dismissing results on the basis of a failure to meet
conventional statistical levels of significance risks levitating babies
and bathwater\ldots{}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Getting it
`right'}{Getting it right}}\label{getting-it-right}

Suppose instead that we had designed and implemented our sample
recruitment according to \ref(fig:ggHPSampleSizeFig80) so that we have a
reasonable chance of detecting a difference of \textasciitilde{} 14\%
with power = 0.8 and at a significance level (p) of 0.05. This means we
should have a sample of around 4000 households split equally (and
randomly) between our trial and two intervention groups.

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{\label{tab:creatLargeN}Number of households and summary statistics per group}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r}
\hline
group & mean W & sd W & n households\\
\hline
Control & 139.28889 & 292.78141 & 1137\\
\hline
Intervention 1 & 36.47888 & 84.60407 & 835\\
\hline
Intervention 2 & 60.40882 & 113.37202 & 1054\\
\hline
Intervention 3 & 73.64247 & 147.39290 & 1174\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{sizingDemandResponseTrialsNZ_files/figure-latex/largeNmeanDiffs-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:largeNmeanDiffs}Mean W demand per group for large sample
(Error bars = 95\% confidence intervals for the sample mean)}
\end{figure}

In comparison to \ref(fig:ggMeanDiffs) we can now see
(\ref(fig:largeNmeanDiffs)) that the 95\% confidence intervals for the
group means are much narrower. This is almost entirely due to the larger
sample sizes. Re-running our previous test for differences now produces:

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  largeTestDT[group == "Intervention 2"]$meanW and largeTestDT[group == "Control"]$meanW
## t = -8.4284, df = 1491.1, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -97.23786 -60.52228
## sample estimates:
## mean of x mean of y 
##  60.40882 139.28889
\end{verbatim}

In this case:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  effect size = 78.880071W or 56.63\% representing a still
  \emph{reasonable bang for buck} for whatever caused the difference;
\item
  95\% confidence interval for the test = -97.24 to -60.52 representing
  \emph{much less} uncertainty/variation;
\item
  p value of 0 representing a \emph{very low} risk of a false positive
  result as it passes all conventional thresholds.
\end{itemize}

So now we are able to be much more confident in our decision to
implement Intervention 2 since the average effect is reasonably large,
the expected variation in the effect size is reasonably narrow and the
risk of a Type I (false positive) error is extremely small.

\section{Summary and recomendations}\label{summary-and-recomendations}

\subsection{Statistical power and sample
design}\label{statistical-power-and-sample-design}

Get it right \emph{first time}: we should do the statistical power
analysis before we start to make sure the study is even worth trying. If
we don't have previous data to use, we \emph{justify} our choices
through power analysis based on defensible assumptions.

\subsection{Reporting statistical tests of difference
(effects)}\label{reporting-statistical-tests-of-difference-effects}

Report all three elements \emph{always}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  average effect size
\item
  effect size confidence intervals
\item
  the p value (risk of Type I errors)
\end{itemize}

We should also report the statistical power used just to be clear on the
risk of Type II errors.

\subsection{Making inferences and taking
decisions}\label{making-inferences-and-taking-decisions}

Pay attention to all three elements \emph{always}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  average effect size: what is the \emph{average bang for buck}?
\item
  effect size confidence intervals: \emph{how uncertain is the bang}?
\item
  the p value: \emph{what is the risk of a false positive}?
\end{itemize}

If we have ticked all the boxes so far then we have combined good study
design based on statistical power analysis, with a nuanced understanding
of what test statistic effect sizes, confidence intervals and p values
can tell us. As a result we now have a robust, evidence-based,
contextually meaningful and \emph{defensible} strategy.

\section{Ackowledgements}\label{ackowledgements}

We would like to thank collaborators and partners on a number of applied
research projects for prodding us into thinking about these issues more
deeply and clearly than we othweise would have done. We hope this paper
helps to bring some clarity.
