\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In our experiennce of designing and running empirical studies, whether
experimental or naturalistic, there is ongoing confusion over the
meaning and role of two key statistical terms:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  statistical power
\item
  statistical significance
\end{itemize}

We have found this to be the case both in academic research where the
objective is to establish `the most likely explanation' under academic
conventions and in applied research where the objective is to `make a
robust decision' based on the balance of evidence and probability.

In this brief paper we respond to these confusions using a worked
example: the design of a hypothetical household electricity demand
response trial in New Zealand which seeks to shift the use of Heat Pumps
out of the evening winter peak demand period. We use this example to
explain and demonstrate the role of statistical signficance in testing
for differences and of both statistical signficance and statistical
power in sample design and decision making.

\section{Error, power, significance and decision
making}\label{error-power-significance-and-decision-making}

Two types of error are of concern in both purely academic and applied
research studies:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type I: a false positive - an effect is inferred when in fact there is
  none. From a commercial or policy perspective this could lead to the
  implementation of a costly intervention which would be unlikely to
  have the effect expected;
\item
  Type II: a false negative - an effect is not inferred when in fact
  there is one. From a commercial or policy perspective this could lead
  to inaction when an intervention would have been likely to have the
  effect expected.
\end{itemize}

The significance level (p value) of the statistical test to be used
represents the extent to which the observed data matches the null model
to be tested (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016). In most trials the null model
will be a measure of `no difference' between control and intervenion
groups. By convention, the p value \emph{threshold} for rejecting the
null model (the risk of a Type I error) is generally set to 0.05 (5\%)
although this choice is entirely subjective. In commercial or policy
terms an action taken on a larger p value (e.g.~setting the p value
threshold to 10\%) would increase the risk of making a Type I error and
thus implementing a potentially costly intervention that is unlikely to
have the effect desired. However, as we discuss in more detail below,
this is not necessarily \emph{bad practice} as it may reflect the
potential magnitude of an effect, the decision-maker's tolerance of Type
I error risk and the urgency of action.

Statistical power is normally set to 0.8 (80\%) by convention and
represents the pre-study risk of making a Type II error (Greenland et
al. 2016). From a commercial or policy perspective reducing power
(e.g.~to 0.7 or 70\%) will therefore increase the risk of taking no
action when in fact the intervention would probably have had the effect
desired. Statistical power calculations enable the investigator to
estimate the sample size that would be needed to robustly detect an
experimental effect with a given risk of a false positive (Type I error)
or false negative (Type II error) result. This prevents a study from
recruiting too few participants to be able to robustly detect the
hypothesised intervention effect (Delmas, Fischlein, and Asensio 2013)
or wasting resources by recruiting a larger sample than needed.

Previous work has suggested that sample sizes in most energy efficiency
studies may be too low to provide adequate power and so statistically
robust conclusions cannot be drawn at conventional thresholds (Frederiks
et al. 2016) while a more recent review focusing on demand response
studies reaching a similar conclusion (Srivastava, Van Passel, and Laes
2018). It is therefore hardly surprising that a number of studies report
effect sizes which are not statistically significant at conventional
thresholds (Srivastava, Van Passel, and Laes 2018), choose to use lower
statistical significance thresholds (Institute 2006, AECOM (2011), CER
(2012), Schofield et al. (2015)) or both lower statistical power values
\emph{and} statistical significance thresholds (UKPN 2017,UKPN (2018)).

However it would be wrong to conclude that this is \emph{necessarily}
bad practice. Recent discussions of the role of p values in inference
(Greenland et al. 2016, Wasserstein and Lazar (2016)) should remind us
that decisions should never be based only on statistical significance
thresholds set purely by convention. Rather, inference and thus decision
making should be based on:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  statistic effect size - is it 2\% or 22\% (i.e.~is the result
  \emph{important} or \emph{useful}, what is the \emph{bang for buck}?)
\item
  statistic confidence intervals - (i.e.~is there \emph{uncertainty} or
  \emph{variation} in response?)
\item
  statistic p values - (i.e.~what is the risk of a Type I error /
  \emph{false positive})
\end{itemize}

As an example, consider the a study which collected electricity power
demand data for two different groups of households. The data shows that
the mean W for group 1 was 35.14 and for group 2 was 162.67. This is a
(very) large difference in the mean of 127.53.

A t-test of the difference between the groups produces the result shown
below.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  testDT[group == "S"]$meanW and testDT[group == "W"]$meanW
## t = -1.9907, df = 31.47, p-value = 0.05526
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -258.110005    3.050644
## sample estimates:
## mean of x mean of y 
##  35.13947 162.66915
\end{verbatim}

In this case we have:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  effect size = 127.5296803W or 78.4\% representing a \emph{substantial
  bang for buck} for whatever caused the difference;
\item
  95\% confidence interval for the test = -258.11 to 3.05 representing
  \emph{considerable} uncertainty/variation;
\item
  p value of 0.055 representing a \emph{relatively low} risk of a false
  positive results but which (just) fails the conventional p \textless{}
  0.05 threshold.
\end{itemize}

What would we have concluded? We have a large effect size, substantial
uncertainty and a slightly raised risk of a false positive or Type I
error when compared to conventional p value levels. From a narrow and
conventional `p value testing' perspective we would have concluded that
there was no statistically signficant difference between the groups.
However this misses the crucial point that an organisation with a higher
risk tolerance might conclude that the large effect size justifies
implementing the intervention even though the risk of a false positive
is slightly higher. If the p value had been 0.25 then this would have
still been the case but would have warranted even further caution. As
the recent discussions of the role of the p value in decision making
have made clear (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016) statistical analysis needs
to report all of these elements to enable contextually appropriate and
defensible evidence-based decisions to be taken. Simply dismissing
results on the basis of failure to meet conventional statistical levels
of significance risks throwing both the baby and the bath water out of
the window.

In the following sections we apply these principles to the design and
analysis of a hypothetical New Zealand household electricity demand
response trial.

\section{Sample design: statistical
power}\label{sample-design-statistical-power}

To return to the discussion of statistical power, we need to establish
the probably size of the control and intervention groups we will
require. This is an aid to resource budgeting (\emph{``How many
households and thus \texttt{\$} do I need?''}) and to ensure good study
design practice (``\emph{Will I be able to answer my research
question?}'') (Frederiks et al. 2016).

Calculation of the required sample size for a control and intervention
group requires the estimation of the probable intervention effect size,
agreement on the significance level (p value threshold or Type I error
risk) of the statistical test to be used and agreement on the level of
statistical power (Type II error risk). Given any three of these values
the fourth can be calculated if an estimate of the mean and standard
deviation of the outcome to be measured is known. In the case of DSR
interventions the effect size comprises a given \% reduction in energy
demand or consumption in a given time period and estimates of the likely
reduction can be derived from previous studies or data.

As we have noted the choice of significance level (p value threshold)
and statistical power are subjective and normative. Most academic
researchers will struggle to justify relaxing from the conventional p =
0.05 and power = 0.8. However as we have discussed there may be good
reason in applied research to take action on results of studies that use
less conservative thresholds. Nevertheless there is a strong argument
for designing such studies using the more conservative conventional
levels but acknowledging that making inferences from the results may
require a more relaxed approach to Type I or Type II error risks than is
considered `normal' in academic research.

## Scale for 'y' is already present. Adding another scale for 'y', which
## will replace the existing scale.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## Saving 6.5 x 4.5 in image
\end{verbatim}

As an illustration, \ref(fig:ggHPSampleSizeFig) shows sample size
calculations using `Heat Pump' electricity demand extracted from the
publicly available New Zealand Green Grid household electricity demand
data (Anderson et al. 2018) for winter 2014 for the peak demand period
(16:00 - 20:00) on weekdays.

As a guide, these results suggest that a trial comprising a control and
intervention sample of 1000 households (each) would be able to detect an
effect size of XXX with p = 0.05 and power = 0.8. Were a study to be
less risk averse in it's decision making then p = 0.1 may be acceptable
in which case only \textasciitilde{} XXX households would be needed in
each group (see \ref(fig:sampleSizeFig)) but the risk of a Type I error
would increase. Reducing the statistical power used would also reduce
the sample required for a given effect size tested at a given p value.
However in this case the risk of a Type II error would increase.
