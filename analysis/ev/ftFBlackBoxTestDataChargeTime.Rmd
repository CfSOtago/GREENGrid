# Load and check data

## Load data

In this section we load and describe the pre-processed safe data from `r dFile`. First we load the data.

```{r load ftf data, echo=TRUE}
ftfDT <- data.table::as.data.table(readr::read_csv(dFile))
```

That loaded `r tidyNum(nrow(ftfDT))` observations.

## Create derived variables

Next we create some useful derived variables. Errors may be 'odd' dates and times or even not set in the original data as we see below.

```{r check ftf data, echo = TRUE}
t <- ftfDT[is.na(rDate), .(nObs = .N,
                           meanPackVolts = mean(`Pack volts`)), 
           keyby = .(`Date (GPS)`, `Time (GPS)`)]

kableExtra::kable(caption = "Number of obs and mean pack volts where date cannot be set by original GPS Date and Time", t) %>% kable_styling()

t <- ftfDT[is.na(rTime), .(nObs = .N,
                           meanPackVolts = mean(`Pack volts`)), 
           keyby = .(`Date (GPS)`, `Time (GPS)`)]

kableExtra::kable(caption = "Number of obs and mean pack volts where time cannot be set by original GPS Date and Time", t) %>% kable_styling()

```

We remove these NAs from the data 

> _XX (should we - what does GPS NA mean? no signal?) XX _

```{r removeNA}
# remove NA dates
before <- nrow(ftfDT)
ftfDT <- ftfDT[!is.na(rDate)]
after <- nrow(ftfDT)

pcGPSNA <- round((before - after)/before*100, 2)
```

Doing so removed `r before - after` (`r pcGPSNA` %) observations.

## Check variables of interest for this analysis

Check charger related variables. We think these are:

 * `Charger (amps)`
 * `Charger (V)`

Multiplying these two will give power in W. Figures \@ref(fig:checkAmps) to \@ref(fig:checkPower) examine the distribution of amps, volts and the derived W.

```{r setCaptions}
# for plots
figCaption <- paste0("FlipTheFleet 'Black Box' test data for 1 car for ", 
                     uniqueN(ftfDT$rDate), " days from ",
                     min(ftfDT$rDate, na.rm = TRUE), " to ", max(ftfDT$rDate, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r checkAmps, fig.cap="Distribution of charger amp readings by car"}
ggplot(ftfDT, aes(x = `Charger (amps)`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  facet_grid(evID ~ .) +
  labs(caption = figCaption)
```

```{r checkVolts, fig.cap="Distribution of charger volt readings"}
ggplot(ftfDT, aes(x = `Charger (V)`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  facet_grid(evID ~ .) +
  labs(caption = figCaption)
```

```{r checkPower, fig.cap="Distribution of derived power demand"}

ftfDT <- ftfDT[, powerW := `Charger (amps)` * `Charger (V)`]

ggplot(ftfDT, aes(x = powerW/1000)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  facet_grid(evID ~ .) +
  labs(x = "kW", caption = figCaption)
```

The following table sumarises these distributions.

```{r summaryTable, fig.cap="Summary table"}
t <- summary(ftfDT[, c("Charger (amps)", "Charger (V)", "powerW")])

kableExtra::kable(caption = "Summary of Charger (amps)", t) %>% kable_styling()
```

_XX Is the Amp reading of 33 an outlier? If so should we ignore the ~= 8kW values? XX_

# Analysis: Timing of charging

We assume `powerW` is a good indicator of charging. For now we do not exclude the apparent outlier caused by the few very high Amp values (`Charger (amps)` > 30) but we flag them as potential problems.

```{r flagAmpOutliers}
ftfDT <- ftfDT[, ampOutlier := ifelse(`Charger (amps)` > 30, "Possible Amp data error?", "OK Amp data")]
```

Figure \@ref(fig:plotChargingTime) shows mean kW by time of day over the entire test datset of `r uniqueN(ftfDT$rDate)` days from `r min(ftfDT$rDate, na.rm = TRUE)` to `r max(ftfDT$rDate, na.rm = TRUE)`.

```{r plotChargingTime, fig.cap="Inferred charging times and power draw (all data)"}
plotDT <- ftfDT[, .(meanPowerW = mean(powerW)), keyby = .(rTime, rDow, ampOutlier,geoLoc, evID)]

myPlot <- ggplot(plotDT, aes(x = rTime, y = meanPowerW/1000, colour = ampOutlier)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(evID + rDow ~ ampOutlier + geoLoc) +
  labs(x='Time of Day', y = "Mean kW", caption = figCaption) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") #  legend
  
  myPlot
  
  # myPlot + scale_x_time(breaks = c(hms::as.hms("00:00:00"), hms::as.hms("03:00:00"), hms::as.hms("06:00:00"),
  #                         hms::as.hms("09:00:00"), hms::as.hms("12:00:00"), hms::as.hms("15:00:00"), 
  #                         hms::as.hms("18:00:00"), hms::as.hms("21:00:00"), hms::as.hms("24:00:00")))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:plotChargingTime) seems to show that the very high Amp values occured on one Sunday and we also appear to see some night charging 'not at home' which may indicate our location inference is imperfect. We re-draw this plot (Figure \@ref(fig:plotChargingTimeClean)) excluding the Amp outliers and also excluding values of exactly 0 for clarity.

```{r plotChargingTimeClean, fig.cap="Inferred charging times and power draw (outliers and exactly zero values excluded)", fig.height=6}
myPlot <- ggplot(plotDT[ampOutlier == "OK Amp data" & !is.na(rDow) & meanPowerW != 0], aes(x = rTime, y = meanPowerW/1000)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rDow ~ evID + geoLoc) +
  labs(x='Time of Day', y = "Mean kW", caption = figCaption) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") #  legend
  
myPlot + scale_x_time(breaks = c(hms::as.hms("00:00:00"), hms::as.hms("06:00:00"),
                        hms::as.hms("12:00:00"), hms::as.hms("18:00:00"), hms::as.hms("24:00:00")))
```

We can see that this car appears to be on an overnight charging timer at home although we do still see charging scattered through the rest of the day. 

So where is the non-home charging happening? We need a way to infer other locations without being disclosive.

# Conclusions

Questions to be asked

 * Data:
    + Do the Amp & Volt distributions look right?
    + Cause of Amp outliers?
    + Date/Time NA (`r pcGPSNA` % of observations) are due to a lack of GPS date/time (and lat/long). Does this mean that there is no date/time in the data when GPS has no signal? Our tests suggest that other data (e.g. power etc) is logged even though there is no date/time. Do we need another source of date/time? Could we infer time from seconds since powered on (assumes GPS OK at start-up?)?
 * Research:
    + Do all FlipTheFleet EV owners charge like this?
    + Where are the EVs being charged when not at home and how can we tell?
    + Does it vary by car/tariff/commute pattern/main use?
    + What other patterns exist and how much within-vehicle and between-vehicle variation is there?
